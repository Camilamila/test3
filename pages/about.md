# **About Me**

Hi I am **Camila** :wave:,<br>
a social data scientist currently working as a Lead Data Analyst for the [Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/). I have experience in data analysis, data trainings, open data, research, media and communication. My multidisciplinary background allows me to tackle social science questions with data-driven approaches to generate valuable insights and drive change. 

I have previously worked in open data initiatives, trainings and research projects across Latin America and as a data driven journalist for media organizations. I am a team oriented person who knows the value of collaboration and diverse work environments. 

Skills in R, Python, SQL, econometrics, data visualization, social network analysis, applied machine learning and multimedia storytelling. 

I am a former UK Foreign Office Chevening Scholar, a native Spanish speaker, fully fluent in English and advanced in French.
